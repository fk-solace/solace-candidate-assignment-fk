# Solace Candidate Assignment - Discussion

## Project Overview

This project implements an advocate search and management system with a modern React frontend and a Next.js API backend. The application allows users to search for healthcare advocates by various criteria, view their details, and navigate through paginated results.

## Completed Tasks

### Database and Backend

✅ **Implement proper database schema with relations**
- Created a normalized database schema with appropriate relationships between advocates, specialties, and locations
- Implemented data integrity constraints and optimized data types

✅ **Implement server-side pagination for advocates endpoint**
- Added support for both page-based and cursor-based pagination
- Implemented configurable page sizes (10, 25, 50 items per page)
- Added comprehensive pagination metadata in responses
- Included proper HTTP caching headers and Link headers following RFC 5988

✅ **Add sorting functionality with proper database queries**
- Implemented sorting for all relevant advocate fields
- Added support for both ascending and descending sort directions
- Applied sorting at the database level for optimal performance

✅ **Implement efficient server-side filtering**
- Created a flexible filtering system for advocate data
- Implemented text search for name and phone number fields
- Optimized queries with appropriate database indexes

### Frontend

✅ **Create reusable API client for advocate data**
- Implemented a structured API client with proper TypeScript interfaces
- Added service modules for all advocate-related operations
- Created utility functions for building query parameters

✅ **Split page.tsx into smaller reusable components**
- Extracted AdvocateSearch, AdvocateTable, and pagination components
- Implemented proper TypeScript interfaces for all component props
- Created custom hooks for search logic and data fetching

## Future Improvements

The following tasks were identified but not yet implemented. They represent valuable future enhancements to the application:

### Database Improvements

⬜ **Set up database migration system**
- Would provide a robust way to manage schema changes over time
- Important for maintaining data integrity during application updates

⬜ **Add strategic indexes for frequently queried fields**
- Would significantly improve query performance for large datasets
- Critical for scaling to hundreds of thousands of advocates

⬜ **Implement proper database connection pooling**
- Would optimize database connections for concurrent users
- Essential for production deployment with significant traffic

⬜ **Add comprehensive seed data with realistic advocate profiles**
- Would provide better testing data with realistic distributions
- Important for performance testing and UI demonstrations

### API Improvements

⬜ **Implement error handling middleware**
- Would provide consistent error responses across all endpoints
- Important for better debugging and user experience

⬜ **Add input validation for all API endpoints**
- Would ensure data integrity and prevent security issues
- Critical for production-ready API endpoints

### Frontend Enhancements

⬜ **Implement advanced search interface**
- Would allow more sophisticated filtering by specialty, location, etc.
- Important for users who need to find very specific advocates

⬜ **Add advocate detail view**
- Would provide more comprehensive information about each advocate
- Important for users making decisions about which advocate to contact

⬜ **Implement responsive mobile design**
- Would improve usability on mobile devices
- Important for users who need to access the system on different devices

⬜ **Add accessibility improvements**
- Would ensure the application is usable by people with disabilities
- Important for compliance with accessibility standards
